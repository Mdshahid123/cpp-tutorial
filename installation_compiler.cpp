//for buiilding a software we should have folloing like header file ,library,comiler and code editor

//installation of mingw and code editor

//when we install the mingw then we get comiler,headerfile and library for c/cpp and code editor we have to install separatelly


//step-1 type mingw download and go to the first link

//When we install MinGW-w64, we get three main folders:

// bin/ → Contains compiler (gcc.exe), linker (ld.exe), and other tools.
// lib/ → Contains C Standard Library (libc.a) and other compiled libraries.
// include/ → Has C/C++ header files (stdio.h, stdlib.h).

//Preprocessor → cpp.exe
//Handles #include, #define, and other preprocessor directives.


//2️⃣ Compiler → cc1.exe
//Converts the preprocessed code into assembly code.


//3️⃣ Assembler → as.exe
//Converts the assembly code into machine code (object file .o).

//4️⃣ Linker → ld.exe
//Links the object file with libraries to generate the final executable (.exe or a.out).

//You can find these executables inside the MinGW/bin directory when you install MinGW-w64



//step-02 install code editor
